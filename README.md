# books-clustering
Cluster books with k-means clustering. <br>
The books were randomly selected. I use the following data about books for clusterization: 
* words count (http://wordcounters.com/word-count/results/), 
* reviews count (https://www.goodreads.com), 
* year of publication. 

It would be better to use more related parameters. For example:
* the date of publication of a particular edition of the book, 
* its price, 
* the number of copies.
